    It returns a dict maps from an object to its location. The dict excludes
    those objects whose location lookup failed.

    Args:
        object_refs (List[ObjectRef]): List of object refs.
        timeout_ms: The maximum amount of time in micro seconds to wait
            before returning. Wait infinitely if it's negative.
        skip_get_locations: Whether or not to skip the get_object_locations call.

    Returns:
        A dict maps from an object to its location. The dict excludes those
        objects whose location lookup failed.

        The location is stored as a dict with following attributes:

        - node_ids (List[str]): The hex IDs of the nodes that have a
          copy of this object.

        - object_size (int): The size of data + metadata in bytes.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if the processes were not started by ray.init().
        ray.exceptions.GetTimeoutError: if it couldn't finish the
            request in time.
